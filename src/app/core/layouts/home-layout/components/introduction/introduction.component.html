        A cancer diagnosis is never expected. Yet, statistics show that many will face it in their lifetime. The question isn’t 
        'if' but 'when' and how prepared you are to take control. <br /><br />
        
        Cancer care isn’t just about treatment — it’s about making the right decisions early to reduce risk, extend longevity, and maximize quality of life.

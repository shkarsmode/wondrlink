</p>

<p>
    Program sponsors,researchers and clinicians not Wondrlink, are responsible for the safety of compassionate use protocols and the validity of listing information.
</p>

<p>
    We make every effort to share as much data with you as possible, but nothing present on Wondrlink should be treated as medical advice.
</p>

    Wondrlink does not make any warranties, expressed or implied, with respect to data contained in our database, and, furthermore, assumes no liability for any party's use, or the results of such use, of any part of the database.
</p>

<h2>DISCLAIMER</h2>

<p>Listing a program on this site does not mean it has been evaluated by Wondrlink. The safety and scientific validity of a program listed on Wondrlink is the responsibility of the program sponsor and investigators. Know the risks and potential benefits of compassionate use programs and talk to your health care provider before participating.</p>

<p>Wondrlink aggregates data from compassionate use programs sponsored or funded by a broad range of public and private organizations around the world. Not all programs listed on Wondrlink are funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) or other agencies of the U.S. Federal Government. Not all listed programs are regulated and/or reviewed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or other governmental entities.</p>

<p>Information on Wondrlink is provided by program sponsors and investigators, and they are responsible for ensuring that the programs follow all applicable laws and regulations. Wondrlink does not verify the scientific validity or relevance of the submitted information beyond a limited quality control review for apparent errors, deficiencies, or inconsistencies.

</p>

<p>
